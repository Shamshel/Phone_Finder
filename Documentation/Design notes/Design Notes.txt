------------------- Battery life -------------------
Is 1 year feasable? ---------
Standard button cell battery (Alkaline) capacity is 150mAh (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_cell)

Assume 15 mA peak transfer current
Using DigiKey battery life estimator (http://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-battery-life)
7 hours fully active peak transmit

7hr/yr=3600s/1hr*yr/365day=69.04s/day

typical transmit time is a few mS

--------------------- Chipsets ---------------------

RN4020+PIC12lf
	RN4020=$18 + pic12lf=$0.5
	~16mA peak transmit power
	3.3-1.8 - (on system DC/DC converter to minimize current at 1.8V?)
	RN4020 all in one--low TTM
	Simple UART+GPIO interrupt and sleep profiles
	Fixed GATT (SPP-Serial Port Profile)
	Larger board space occupied

Nordic nRF51822
	$1-5 per SoC + BoM
	ARM cortex-M0 (way overkill computationally)
	REALLY cool
		DC/DC converter
		LDO
		generous number of board layouts/schematic examples
		BoM for all of the above
	10.5mA TX at 0dBm
	16mA TX at +4dBm
	Would need debugger/programmer $60+shipping: (j-link edu: http://shop-us.segger.com/J_Link_EDU_p/8.08.90.htm)
	

Texas Instruments CC2640
	$7 per SoC + BoM
	ARM cortex-M0 + ARM cortex-M3 (way wayyy overkill computationally)
	also, REALLY cool
		DC/DC converter
		onboard battery monitor
		numerous example schematics/layouts and reference examples
	6.1mA TX at 0dBm (!?!)
	9.1mA TX at +5dBm (!?!)
	Would need debugger/programmer $129.00+shipping: (XDS100v3: http://www.spectrumdigital.com/product_info.php?products_id=251)

bluegiga (silicon labs) BLE113/BLE112
	$14.72 per SoC
	based on TI CC25XX 8051 (circa 1990? apparently enhanced and still used)
	completely contained SoC, this and a supply is basically all that's needed
	pretty cool
		direct to USB programming and debugging (after firmware update)
		can be programmed in a scripting language (BGScript) or in C
		LOTS of BGScript examples
		flexible GATT definitions
		some appnotes, no BoM
	max TX power 0 dBm :/
	18.2 mA at 0 dBm
	14.3 mA at 0 dBm with suggested DC/DC
	submitted user account registration for access to documentation (really? register for documents?)
	Would need debugger/programmer $49.00+shipping (CC Debugger: http://www.ti.com/tool/cc-debugger)
